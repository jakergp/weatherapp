## Weather Web App
A responsive and minimalist weather application built with JavaScript and powered by the Visual Crossing Weather API. This project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs, handle asynchronous data and create dynamic user-friendly interfaces.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for weather information by city or location.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

### What I Learned:
- Working with RESTful APIs and handling JSON data.
- Implementing asynchronous JavaScript.
